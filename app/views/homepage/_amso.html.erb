  <h3>Civil Rights Digital Library</h3>
  <p>
    In recognition of the sesquicentennial of the start of the American Civil
    War, Civil War in the American South provides a central portal to access
    digital collections from the Civil War Era (1850-1865) held by members of
    the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL).
  </p>
  <p>
    ASERL members hold deep and extensive collections documenting the history
    and culture of the American South, developed over hundreds of years to
    support scholarly research and teaching. Many of the special or unique
    manuscripts, photographs, books, newspapers, broadsides, and other materials
    have been digitized to provide broader access to these documents for
    scholars and students around the world. Civil War in the American South is
    a collaborative initiative to provide a single, shared point of access to
    the Civil War digital collections held at many individual libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site currently links to more than 10,000 items from 32 libraries. The
    shared collection continues to grow, providing ready access to a world-class
    collection of primary source materials from the American Civil War era.
