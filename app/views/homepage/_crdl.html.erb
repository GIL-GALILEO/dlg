    The struggle for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s is among
    the most far-reaching social movements in the nation's history,
    and it represents a crucial step in the evolution of American
    democracy. The Civil Rights Digital Library promotes an enhanced
    understanding of the Movement by helping users discover primary
    sources and other educational materials from libraries, archives,
    museums, public broadcasters, and others on a national scale. The
    CRDL features a collection of unedited news film from the WSB
    (Atlanta) and WALB (Albany, Ga.) television archives held by the
    Walter J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Collection at
    the University of Georgia Libraries. The CRDL provides educator
    resources and contextual materials, including <i>Freedom on Film</i>,
    relating instructive stories and discussion questions from the
    Civil Rights Movement in Georgia, and the <i>New Georgia
    Encyclopedia</i>, delivering engaging online articles and multimedia.

    CRDL is a partnership among librarians, technologists, archivists,
    educators, scholars, academic publishers, and public broadcasters.
    The initiative received support through a National Leadership
    Grant for Libraries awarded to the University of Georgia by the
    Institute of Museum and Library Services.
