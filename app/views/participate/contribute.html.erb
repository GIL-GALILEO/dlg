    <p><%= link_to 'DLG\'s mission', about_mission_path %> includes supporting Georgia cultural heritage institutions with all aspects of the digitization cycle from selection to delivery. In addition, we host four portals (Georgia, Civil Rights, Civil War, and historic newspapers) and funnel metadata to the Digital Public Library of America.</p>
    <p>If you have existing digital projects and metadata to share, let us know using our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_rN1-TcH_C267XVwe2THhndzrL_qXuP15Drc1eCyh74" target="_blank">DLG Collection Harvesting Request form</a>. We are happy to ingest metadata that meets our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LtCncs-uMcE4HRQzPuvXHcr9Is3Md223zmWz0shmB0w" target="_blank">minimum metadata guidelines</a> and can accept records via harvesting or spreadsheet submission. We are harvested by DPLA  quarterly (March, June, September, and December).</p>
    <p>Don’t have online collections yet? Here’s a quick summary of what you’ll need to consider before starting. We’re happy to help you get your project started.</p>
